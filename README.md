> write I/O agnostic utilities

# What is it?
`adapter` is a tiny TypeScript helper for writing I/O agnostic utilities in a standardized way.  Your code could run in a headless process, an interactive commandline tool, or in a graphical program, but either way your code remains the same.

This is hard to appreciate without an example, so let's take a look at one:

# Example
Let's say you have some code that creates a remote repository via the GitHub API.  It might look something like this:

```typescript
import {httpClient} from 'some-http-package';

const url = 'https://api.github.com/user/repos';
const headers = {Authorization: 'token XXX'};
const data = {name: 'someuser/new-repo'};

console.log('Making request...');
const result = await httpClient.post(url, data, headers);
console.log('Done: ' + result.data);
```

This is a fine proof of concept, but now we need to make it usable.  That's where `adapter` comes in:

```typescript
import {makeAdapter} from 'adapter';

type Resolve = number;
type Output = string;
type Input = {
    'api-key': string,
    'repo-name': string
};

const createRemoteRepo = () => makeAdapter<Resolve, Output, Input>(
    async (resolve, reject, output, input) => {
        const url = 'https://api.github.com/user/repos';
        const headers = {Authorization: 'token ' + await input('api-key')};
        const data = {name: await input('repo-name')};

        output('Making request...');
        const result = await httpClient.post(url, data, headers);
        output('Done: ' + result.data);
        
        resolve(result.statusCode);
    }
);

const result = await createRemoteRepo()
    .input(async (key) => window.prompt(`Please enter your ${key}`))
    .output(msg => window.alert(`Status: ${msg}`))
    .exec();  // this just returns a regular Promise
```

Well this made the code a little bigger, but exactly what did it do for us?  If you're familiar with the Promise API, this might feel like a natural extension:  Promises allow you to inject (or "plug in") the means of handling completion and failure (`resolve` and `reject`), while adapters additionally allow you to inject the means of outputting data and requesting input while the async task is running (`output` and `input`).  This makes our code very portable and reusable!

However, these kinds of structures can easily create anxiety; it's easy to get confused and even easier to make mistakes when someone who did _not_ write your code is required to pass their functions to it.  Luckily the type aliases defined beforehand go a long way.  Let's take a closer look at that:

```typescript
type Resolve = number;
type Output = string;
type Input = {
    'api-key': string,
    'repo-name': string
};

const createRemoteRepo = () => makeAdapter<Resolve, Output, Input>(
    async (resolve, reject, output, input) => {
        // ...
    }
);
```

Because we passed our types as paramters to the `makeAdapter` function, the injected `input` and `output` are completely type-safe.  If you tried to run `output(1)` the compiler would complain because we limited output to strings.  Likewise, the `input` function will only accept `'api-key'` or `'repo-name'`, and has the appropriate return type for each.

# Heads up!
I am still in the process of negotiating rights to the npm package name from the current owner, so you cannot install via npm at the moment.  For the few if any of you who stumble upon this package and are interested: it will be available within a few days.
